@SpringBootApplication
----------------------

The @SpringBootApplication annotation is equivalent to using @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan


@EnableAutoConfiguration
------------------------

Using @EnableAutoConfiguration is like using @Configuration annotation. 
It configures and wires our beans based on what @Bean methods we have defined in our configuration class. 
It does other additional configurations too, which includes configuring/invoking helper components
(like embedded tomcat in web application). This mechanism works based on the jar dependencies available
in the classpath.
