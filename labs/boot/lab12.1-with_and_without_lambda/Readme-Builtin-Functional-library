java.util.function Package:

The java.util.function package in Java 8 contains many builtin functional interfaces like-


Predicate: 
======

The Predicate interface has an abstract method test which gives a Boolean value as a result 
for the specified argument. Its prototype is

public Predicate
{
   public boolean test(T  t);
 }

BinaryOperator: 
==========

The BinaryOperator interface has an abstract method apply which takes two argument
and returns a result of same type. Its prototype is

public interface BinaryOperator 
{
     public T apply(T x, T y);
}       

Function: 
======

The Function interface has an abstract method apply which takes argument of type T and 
returns a result of type R. Its prototype is

public interface Function 
{
   public R apply(T t);
}
