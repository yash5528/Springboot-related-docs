Lambda Expressions 
----------------------

It is basically express instances of functional interfaces (An interface with single abstract method is called 
functional interface. An example is java.lang.Runnable). lambda expressions implement the only abstract
function and therefore implement functional interfaces

Lambda expressions  provide's the below functionalities:

>> Enable to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.
>> A function that can be created without belonging to any class.
>> A lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.

Syntax:

lambda operator -> body

where lambda operator can be:

Zero parameter:

() -> System.out.println("Zero parameter lambda");

One parameter:

(p) -> System.out.println("One parameter: " + p);

Multiple parameters:

(p1, p2) -> System.out.println("Multiple parameters: " + p1 + ", " + p2);
