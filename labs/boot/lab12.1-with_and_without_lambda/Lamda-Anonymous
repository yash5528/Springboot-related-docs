The key difference between Anonymous class and Lambda expression is the usage of 'this' keyword. 
In the anonymous classes, ‘this’ keyword resolves to anonymous class itself, whereas for lambda 
expression ‘this’ keyword resolves to enclosing class where lambda expression is written.

Another difference between lambda expression and anonymous class is in the way these two are compiled.
Java compiler compiles lambda expressions and convert them into private method of the class. 
It uses invokedynamic instruction that was added in Java 7 to bind this method dynamically.

//Anonymous class
Runnable task1 = ()-> {System.out.println("Task #1 is running");

 
Thread thread1 = new Thread(task1);
thread1.start();

------

// Lambda Runnable
Runnable task2 = () -> { System.out.println("Task #2 is running"); };
 
// start the thread
new Thread(task2).start();
