= Service Registry sample

*Message Generation* and *Greeter* are example applications demonstrating the use of Service Registry for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. (For information on the Service Registry product, please http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/service-registry/[see the documentation].)

== Building and Deploying

. Build the two projects from the root (`greeting`) directory. If using Maven, run:
+
....
$ mvn package
....
+
If using Gradle, run `./gradlew build` (OS X, Linux) or `gradlew.bat build` (Windows).
+
....
$ ./gradlew build
....

. Run the deployment script (if you used Maven, link:scripts/deploy_mvn.sh[`scripts/deploy_mvn.sh`] or link:scripts/deploy_mvn.bat[`scripts/deploy_mvn.bat`]; if you used Gradle, link:scripts/deploy_gradle.sh[`scripts/deploy_gradle.sh`] or link:scripts/deploy_gradle.bat[`scripts/deploy_gradle.bat`]).
+
....
$ ./scripts/deploy_gradle.sh
....
+
The script will create a Service Registry service instance and then push the applications and bind them to the service.

. When the script has finished, set the `TRUST_CERTS` environment variable to the API endpoint of your Elastic Runtime instance (as in `api.example.com`), then restage the applications so that the changes will take effect. Setting `TRUST_CERTS` causes Spring Cloud Services to add the the SSL certificate at the specfied API endpoint to the JVM's truststore, so that the client application can communicate with a Service Registry service instance even if your Elastic Runtime instance is using a self-signed SSL certificate (see the http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/service-registry/writing-client-applications.html#self-signed-ssl-certificate[Service Registry documentation]).
+
....
$ cf set-env message-generation TRUST_CERTS api.wise.com
Setting env variable 'TRUST_CERTS' to 'api.wise.com' for app message-generation in org myorg / space development as user...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
$ cf restage message-generation
....
+
....
$ cf set-env greeter CF_TARGET https://api.wise.com
Setting env variable 'CF_TARGET' to 'https://api.wise.com' for app greeter in org myorg / space development as user...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
$ cf restage greeter
....
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the Spring Cloud Services Starters for Service Registry causes all application endpoints to be secured by HTTP Basic authentication. For more information or if you wish to disable this, http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/service-registry/writing-client-applications.html#disable-http-basic-auth[see the documentation]. (HTTP Basic authentication is disabled in these sample applications.)

== Trying It Out

. Visit `[ROUTE]/hello`, where `[ROUTE]` is the route bound to the Greeter application. The Greeter application will use the Service Registry to look up the Message Generation application and get a greeting message, which (to begin with) should be &#8220;Hello, Bob!&#8221;
+

. You can see what the Message Generation application is sending back by viewing its logs. Run `cf logs message-generation`.
+
....
$ cf logs message-generation
Connected, tailing logs for app message-generation in org myorg / space development as user...

. To get a different greeting message, you can provide `salutation` and `name` parameters, as in `[ROUTE]/hello?salutation=Hi&name=John`. The Greeter application will send those parameters to the Message Generation application and the resulting greeting will be customized to match.
