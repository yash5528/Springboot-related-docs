zuul.routes.books.url=http://localhost:8090

here "books" is the context-path

i.e.,

http://localhost:8080/books  is routed to http://localhost:8090

-------

similarly for the below route

zuul.routes.test.url=http://localhost:8090/available

results are

http://localhost:8080/test  is routed to http://localhost:8090/available
